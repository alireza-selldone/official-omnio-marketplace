# AI Agent Guide

This project is a fully static Selldone storefront plus browser-side dashboard. Follow these rules when editing it.

## Omnio Contract

- The connected shop is Omnio (`15596`, `marko-5vMFPy7t`), not the Fashioni source shop.
- Alio (`6178`, `alio`) is the fashion seller: 195 products across category ids `108846`–`108853`.
- Merino (`6179`, `merino`) is the electronics seller: 127 products across category ids `108828`–`108842`.
- Seller allocation is real Selldone variant-offer data. Never implement seller ownership as a display-only badge.
- Public fallback seller presentation lives in `storefront/marketplace-config.js`; it may fill a pending vendor's name and description but must never supply price, stock, quantity, or checkout state.
- Dedicated seller routes are `vendors.html` and `vendor.html?vendor=alio|merino`. Keep them in responsive audits, dead-control checks, footer/link checks, and deployment builds.
- The seven audience shortcuts use exact restored product ids from the validated pre-cleanup snapshot because the public product-list payload omits shortcut relationships. Update those sets only after a fresh source/target comparison and a recoverable backup.
- The supplied `walmart screenshot omnio store/` folder is reference material only. Preserve it locally and exclude it from Git and deployment.

## Core Architecture

- Storefront source lives in `storefront/` and is served at `/`.
- Dashboard source lives in `dashboard/` and is served at `/dashboard/`.
- OAuth callback source lives in `callback/` and is served at `/callback/`.
- Shared browser modules live in `shared/`.
- Static production output is generated into `dist/` by `scripts/build-static.mjs`.
- Local product research under `storefront/assets/products/variants/references/` is never public build input; preserve it in the workspace but keep it out of `dist`, packages, Git, and deployment.
- Local migration snapshots under `backups/` are recovery material. Preserve them in the workspace but keep them out of Git and deployment because they can contain private account metadata.
- `scripts/dev-static.mjs` is only a local development file server. Do not add production Node server behavior.
- Cloudflare Workers Static Assets must deploy `dist/` only through `wrangler deploy`. Do not deploy `.env`, logs, temp files, auth files, local browser profiles, or `dist/` source artifacts to git.

## Runtime Config

- Public runtime config is stored in HTML meta tags in `storefront/index.html`, `dashboard/index.html`, and `callback/index.html`.
- Do not add client secrets, API keys, refresh tokens, access tokens, MCP credentials, Cloudflare tokens, or private `.env` values to any public file.
- `.env` is only for local dev server settings such as `STATIC_DEV_PORT` and optional debug proxy settings.

## Selldone API Rules

- Storefront calls must go browser-direct to `https://xapi.selldone.com`.
- Dashboard/backoffice calls must go browser-direct to `https://api.selldone.com`.
- OAuth must use public-client PKCE against `https://selldone.com/oauth`; never use a client secret.
- Storefront and dashboard OAuth tokens must stay separate in localStorage:
  - `pajulina_storefront_oauth_tokens_v1`
  - `pajulina_dashboard_oauth_tokens_v1`
- Do not add Node-only API routes for production features.
- **The `/api/storefront/*` shim is gone** (removed 14 Aug 2026). There is no
  `storefront/static-storefront-api.js`; call `storefrontAuth.session()` and the XAPI
  endpoints directly. Translating a fake path into a real one was all the shim ever did,
  and the indirection hid which XAPI call a feature actually made. Do not reintroduce it.
- Storefront search is client-side over the catalogue already in memory, matching the
  reference app. 35 references do not justify a network round-trip per keystroke.
- Selldone variant storage fields are not reliable presentation categories: legacy
  products can put material/color slugs in `type` or `style`. Use the shared
  `storefront/variant-options.js` classifier for Size; keep Color sourced only from
  `variant.color`, and never flatten every variant field into a size list.
- Treat navigation labels as presentation, never as catalogue structure. `All Products`,
  `Shop by category`, and `Shop by product` must not be created as Selldone categories.
  Each product keeps exactly one real product-type main category; Women, Men, Girls,
  Boys, and Baby are audience shortcuts, with Baby Girls and Baby Boys only beneath
  Baby. Before and after taxonomy writes, reject self-parenting, parent cycles, duplicate
  wrappers, and empty or misleading navigation categories.
- Storefront customer identity comes from `storefrontAuth.session()`, which reads
  XAPI `/me` for the storefront context — never `api.selldone.com`.
- Storefront order history is physical-only and loads from XAPI `GET /shops/@{shop}/basket/orders-PHYSICAL` with the `order-history` scope.
- Storefront order detail loads from XAPI `GET /shops/@{shop}/baskets/{basket_id}` with the storefront customer token.
- Storefront cart reads and mutations must use real Selldone XAPI. This shop sells physical products only, so cart state must load the physical basket from shop-info `baskets` and bill data. Basket item updates use `PUT /shops/@{shop}/basket/{product_id}` with the final `count`.
- Storefront checkout is physical-only: save basket config, refresh physical bill, then call `POST /shops/@{shop}/basket/physical/buy/{gateway_code}`.
- Storefront Stripe checkout must read the publishable key dynamically from Selldone storefront shop info gateway data. Never hardcode Stripe keys.
- Blog reads use the registry endpoints `xapi.blogs.list` (`GET /shops/@{shop}/blogs`)
  and `xapi.blogs.get` (`GET /shops/@{shop}/blogs/{blog_id}`). Three traps, all found by
  testing rather than by reading the docs:
  - `blog_id` on the detail route is the article's **`parent_id`** (the shop-blog record),
    not the article id. Passing the article id returns "Blog not found", which reads like
    a missing endpoint. It is not missing.
  - `?extra=true` returns the category list but an **empty** `articles` array, filling
    `last_articles` instead. Categories and articles need separate calls.
  - The public list carries no category per article, so `loadBlog()` builds the map with
    one filtered call per category (`?category=<id>`). That is bounded by category count
    rather than the N+1 over articles the detail route would force. It is still N+1 in
    the number of categories — acceptable at four, worth revisiting past a dozen.
- Article publication dates cannot be backdated through the API. `created_at` is ignored
  by `api.articles.shop_blog.upsert`, and a past `schedule_at` fires immediately, is
  cleared, and resets `created_at` to the publish moment. Display `created_at` as the
  truth rather than faking a spread. Verified 14 Aug 2026.
- Product comments are article comments. Resolve the product article from `product.article_pack.article.id` or equivalent product info fields; do not use `/shops/@{shop}/products/{id}/reviews` as the primary XAPI path.

## Selldone Image URL Standard

- Use the central Selldone image helpers where present.
- Do not create local one-off image resolvers in feature files.
- Selldone underscore paths must be converted consistently, for example `shops_14952_products_demo` -> `https://cdn.selldone.com/app/shops/14952/products/demo128.png`.

## Dashboard Code Organization

- Keep dashboard feature logic split under `dashboard/features/`.
- `dashboard/app.js` should mainly wire state, top-level rendering, and event bindings.
- New dashboard feature modules should export a `createXFeature(deps)` factory.
- Do not grow `dashboard/app.js` with large feature-specific blocks.

## UI Rules

- The storefront runs on ONE stylesheet, `storefront/styles.css`, organised as a
  numbered design system: tokens -> reset -> type -> layout -> buttons -> product
  card -> rails -> chrome -> overlays -> footer -> home modules -> page modules ->
  target size. It replaced three stacked layers (a serif "Fashioni" base, a v2
  refresh, and a `market-*` override block) that fought each other with roughly
  200 `!important` declarations. Add a component in its numbered section and add
  a token rather than a literal. The only `!important` rules left are `[hidden]`
  and the reduced-motion block, and both carry a comment saying why.
- Colour, spacing, radius, elevation and type are tokens. `--theme-*` is the
  single recolour surface the theme picker and a cloned shop drive; neutrals
  stay fixed so a jewelry or beauty clone changes hue only. Legacy token names
  (`--graphite`, `--dial`, `--rule`, `--blued`, ...) are aliases into the system,
  not a second palette.
- `cardHTML(product, { compact, badge })` in `storefront/app.js` is the only
  product card. Shop grid, homepage rails, savings panels, related strips and
  seller pages all render it, so alignment cannot drift between modules. Reading
  order is price -> name -> brand. Its badge is derived from live data only: a
  real `clearance` tag passed by the caller, otherwise a discount the catalog
  actually carries. Do not reintroduce a decorative "New in" flag.
- A sale countdown renders only inside 7 days of the end date. Selldone discount
  windows are routinely months long and "ends in 60d" on every card was noise.
- Homepage modules remove themselves when they cannot be filled honestly.
  `renderDeals` drops "Today's best prices" below four live discounts rather
  than padding it with full-price stock; the same applies to the savings panels,
  the promo grid and the department spotlight. A slow or unavailable catalog
  must leave a navigable page, never a spinner: see `renderCatalogUnavailable`.
- Hero slides declare an INTENT (`{audience}` or `{kind:"tech"}`), never a URL
  with a product or category id in it. `resolveStoryHref()` turns that into a
  route the live catalog can actually serve, falling back to `shop.html`.
- Promotional cutouts must genuinely cut out. `removePromoImageBackground`
  reports how much it cleared, crops to the subject's own bounding box so tiles
  agree on scale, and a tile whose photograph will not separate from its
  backdrop swaps in the next ranked product from the same department. Do not
  "fix" a failed cutout with a white card behind it — that is banned.
- A panel that is only translated off screen is still painted and still in the
  tab order. `.drawer`, `.cart` and `.sheet` carry `visibility:hidden` when
  closed, with the transition delayed so the slide-out still animates.
- The PDP size table is an inline accordion directly above Specifications, not
  a modal: it is reference material, and as a `<dialog>` it had to be dismissed
  before the sizes it describes could be used. Two lessons worth keeping — an
  author `display` rule on a `<dialog>` defeats the UA's
  `dialog:not([open]){display:none}` whatever the specificity, because author
  styles outrank UA styles; and a size guide is content, not a decision.
- Hero slides carry their own `focus` / `focusMobile`, applied as
  `--hero-focus`. A 16:9 asset on a 2.7:1 stage loses a third of its height,
  and a centred crop took the top off the subject's head.
- Dashboard UI should be English.
- Rear-angle apparel photography is permanently banned from every promotional
  placement. Products may remain in ordinary listings and their PDP, but all
  homepage, navigation, brand, and seller promo selections must pass
  `isPromotionSafeProduct()` / `promotionSafeProducts()` from
  `storefront/shop-data.js`. Prefer excluding a questionable product to
  resurfacing rear-angle imagery.
- The homepage promotional grid has TWO modes and `shop.config.json` decides
  which. Four square tiles and one portrait: the lead tile is 4/10 columns
  across two rows, which lands near 2:3 and takes a portrait asset uncropped.
  - **editorial** — `promoTiles` names a `{category, image, alt, focus}` per
    tile. The photograph fills the tile (`object-fit:cover`), the copy is
    reversed out over a scrim at the foot, and the tile field is dark so
    reversed type stays legible while the image loads. This is what Omnio
    ships, and it is why the tiles stopped being a small cutout adrift in a
    coloured field. Artwork is editorial, shipped in `storefront/assets/promo/`
    and optimised to WebP; the HEADLINE and price hook still come from the live
    catalog, so the picture is styling and the claim is data.
  - **catalog** — no artwork configured. Tiles fall back to a cut-out product
    from their own department on a flat solid field, with no rotation, paper
    card, gradient or shadow, and 24px of clearance from the copy. A clone that
    keeps the code but not the artwork lands here, so do not delete it.
  Both modes: five tiles, at least one technology tile when the catalog has
  one, unique eyebrows, a live price hook in every headline, one pill CTA, and
  no vendor names. `npm run check:bento -- <url>` detects the mode and asserts
  the right set, writing 1440px and 375px screenshots to `artifacts/qa/`.
- Promotional artwork is reviewed by eye before it ships. The rear-angle
  apparel ban covers editorial photography as well as catalog cutouts, and the
  check reads the image `alt` for it — so an accurate `alt` is a safety
  control, not just an accessibility one.
- Every activatable target is at least 44x44 (WCAG 2.5.5). Section 15 of the
  stylesheet holds those rules in one place. `.sdbar` and `.market-footer` are
  held to the 2.5.8 AA floor of 24px instead, which the audit encodes.
- Use Bootstrap-compatible markup and Bootstrap Icons where the dashboard already uses them.
- Keep the visual direction modern, minimal, operational, and compact.
- Do not duplicate account controls; the user account menu belongs in the left sidebar profile.
- Homepage reviews are sample content and must keep their visible label. The average and
  the star distribution are computed by `summariseReviews()` from the review array — never
  typed in. `loadReviews()` is the single switch point: when any product has
  `rate_count > 0` it uses real ratings and the label disappears on its own.
- Storefront `blog.html` and `article.html` are generated by `scripts/build-blog-pages.mjs`
  from index.html's chrome, same as the content pages. Keep the empty state in `blog.js`
  even when posts exist — the next shop starts with none.
- Search and account were rebuilt from scratch, not recovered. The reference app's
  `user-menu`, `account-profile`, `profile-pages` and `static-storefront-api` modules exist
  in no git object: history was reset at project start and the first commit already had
  them removed. Do not go looking for them.
- Storefront content pages (`about-us`, `terms`, `privacy`, `contact-us`) are generated from
  `store-pages/*.md`. Edit the Markdown, not the HTML, and keep the `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` tokens in the
  source.
- Never link a storefront path that only resolves through `not_found_handling`. With
  `single-page-application` set, a missing page answers 200 with the homepage, so a broken link is
  invisible to a status-code check. Assert the response differs from the homepage as well.
  `dev-static.mjs` emulates Cloudflare's `html_handling` so this is testable locally.

## Vendor Pages And Rails

- An unknown vendor slug renders a not-found state. `vendor.html` used to fall
  back to Alio for any unrecognised slug while leaving the wrong slug in the
  URL, so a mistyped or retired seller silently served another vendor's
  catalogue under that vendor's name. Every price, product and department on
  the page belonged to somebody the visitor had not asked for. Treat a seller
  fallback as a data-integrity fault, never as a convenience.
- `View all` on a vendor page goes to `shop.html?vendor=<slug>`, which is a real
  filter in `shop.js`. It previously pointed at `#vendor-products` — the same
  twelve-card rail already on screen.
- Every horizontal rail goes through `initRailNav(rail, nav, label)` in
  `app.js`. A bare overflow container has no role, no name, no tab stop and no
  visible control, so its content is reachable by trackpad and by nothing else.
  The helper adds `role="group"`, an accessible name, a tab stop, arrow-key
  scrolling and prev/next buttons that disable at each end and hide themselves
  when nothing overflows. Native scrolling is untouched.
- Vendor department discovery shows eight tiles and expands on request. Fifteen
  departments as a flat grid ran to 1,702px on a phone. The toggle says "Show
  all departments" — never a count.

## Cards And Swatches

- Cards in a group must end on one line. Two things moved the bottoms: a title
  that ran to one or two lines, and a swatch row that only some products have.
  `.pcard__name` reserves two lines, and the swatch slot is always emitted —
  taking height only when a sibling card in the same group actually has
  swatches, via `:has()`, so a catalog with no colours pays nothing.
- The swatch row never wraps. Five swatches fit one line of a rail card; a
  sixth wrapped and made that card 44px taller than its neighbours. Beyond
  five, the remainder is shown as `+N` and the product page carries them all.
- A variant with no colour is not a colour. Grouping colourless variants under
  a synthetic key turned a bag with one navy variant and three material
  variants into four swatches, three of them blank. A single colour renders no
  selector at all — one colour is not a choice.
- Group colours by `colorKey()`, never by the raw value. Selldone stores the
  same colour with and without an alpha suffix, and grouping on the raw string
  rendered `#243B64` and `#243B64ff` as two identical swatches.
- `swatchLabel()` names every colour by nearest neighbour in `COLOR_NAMES`. It
  used to fall through to the raw uppercase hex, so a screen reader announced
  "#243B64". Add entries to the table rather than special-casing a product.

## Promotional Eligibility

- `isPromotionSafeProduct()` is the single guard for every promotional surface.
  It reads name, category and tags, and is written as garment VOCABULARY —
  rear-emphasis, intimates, swim/beachwear — not as a list of product ids or
  filenames, so it survives a catalog change and a clone.
- Write the pattern as a regex LITERAL. The guard was once assembled with
  `new RegExp` from an array of strings and the escapes did not survive: `\b`
  inside a template literal is a backspace character, not a word boundary, so
  the guard matched nothing at all and six swimwear products walked into the
  homepage rails while the code looked correct.
- `beach` is inside the swim family deliberately. A beach cover-up is not
  objectionable but its catalog photography is swimwear photography, and the
  rule has always preferred one fewer promotional candidate over resurfacing an
  image it should not have.

## Merchandising Selection

- A product earns one slot per page. Deals, brands, the department spotlight
  and the savings panels each ranked the same catalog independently, so 31
  homepage slots carried 24 distinct products. Modules claim what they show via
  the shared ledger in `home.js`; a module still fills itself from claimed
  stock if the unclaimed pool runs short, because an honest repeat beats a
  half-empty rail.

## Loading And Failure

- Every catalog read is bounded by `fetchJson`'s timeout. Without it a hung
  XAPI left the page on skeletons indefinitely, which is worse than an error
  because there is nothing to act on.
- `showCatalogError()` in `app.js` is the one error renderer, and it carries a
  retry. Do not write a second inline error message.
- Warm loads are dominated by XAPI, not by rendering: the slowest single call
  is 1.3–1.8s against 185–515ms of frontend work. Before optimising the
  storefront, measure the split — `performance.getEntriesByType("resource")`
  filtered to `xapi.selldone.com` gives it directly.

## Product Page

- Three columns: gallery, information, and a buy column that is `position:sticky`
  from 1024px up. The price lives in that column, next to the control it belongs
  to. It used to sit at the far left of a full-width fixed bar, a screen away
  from "Add to bag". The fixed `.buybar` is now phone and tablet only — two
  persistent buy controls on one screen is one too many.
- The quantity stepper and the add/buy buttons share one `quantity`. Adding a
  single unit while the control reads three is the kind of quiet mismatch a
  shopper only finds in the bag.
- Section order is product -> what else to buy -> the detail you read before
  deciding -> more to buy -> proof: frequently-bought-together, similar items,
  about (overview + specifications), more from this seller, reviews.
- `pros` renders as Key features with an icon chosen from the benefit's own
  wording. `warranty`, `lead`, `condition` and `original` render as the buy
  column's assurances. All four were already in the catalog and none of them
  were on the page.
- The product article is only used when it is ABOUT the product. Some records
  carry copy belonging to a different item and some carry a single stray
  character, so `overviewHTML` requires a distinctive word from the title to
  appear in the body before trusting it, and falls back to the category blurb.
  It also has to come from `products/{id}/info`; `products/list` does not carry
  `article_pack`, and reading the summary record silently produced the fallback.
- Cross-sell pairing lives in `shop.config.json`. Selldone's cross-sell is a
  backoffice feature and XAPI does not expose it to a storefront — five candidate
  endpoints all 404 and no product field carries it. `pairs` names companions per
  product and anything unlisted falls back to its department. **No bundle
  discount is invented**: this storefront cannot apply one at checkout, and a
  saving that does not happen is a false claim. The button adds every item for
  real, which is the part the reference implementations get wrong — theirs add
  only the product being viewed.
- Review content is demo and says so, because `rate_count` is 0 across this
  catalog and Selldone returns no review photography. The photo strip reuses the
  product's own gallery and only appears with three or more images; one photo
  beside an empty counter reads as a broken grid.
- Rail controls use the shared `data-rail-prev` / `data-rail-next` contract that
  `initRailNav` binds. A rail that invents its own attribute names gets buttons
  with no handler, which is what `check:controls` caught.

## QA Scripts

The checks assert contracts, not one design's magic numbers. Four of them were
pinned to the previous layout and were rewritten rather than deleted:

- `herocheck` asserts the three slides share ONE stage height and are each at
  least 1920x1080, instead of requiring a literal 620px.
- `portcheck` derives the expected department-column count from the live
  category count, and stubs `cdn.selldone.com` so a synthetic fixture's fake
  image path cannot report a CDN 404 as a storefront page error.
- `imgsweep` seeds the cart from whatever the homepage is showing. It used to
  name two product ids from the shop this repo was built against; once the
  catalog moved on it hung for 30s and aborted before measuring shop and
  checkout. A panel that will not open now fails that step and continues.
- `_audit.js` compares the body surface and ink against the resolved `--surface`
  and `--ink` tokens rather than two hardcoded RGB triples, requires only the
  faces actually shipped, and implements WCAG 2.5.5's inline-link exception.
- `bentocheck` detects which promo-grid mode is live and asserts the matching
  set; the mode-independent rules stay in both branches.

There is no lint script and no ESLint config in this repository. The closest
equivalent is a parse check over every module:

    for f in $(find storefront dashboard shared scripts callback -name '*.js' -o -name '*.mjs'); do node --check "$f"; done

If a check fails because the design legitimately changed, generalise the
assertion to the contract. Do not weaken it and do not delete it.

## Git And Editing Hygiene

- The worktree may contain user changes. Do not revert unrelated files.
- Use focused patches and avoid broad refactors unless requested.
- Do not commit `.env`, tokens, secrets, generated `dist/`, logs, temp files, local auth files, or browser profile folders.
- When adding or deleting source files for this static package, stage the relevant source changes with git so they are not missed before deployment.
- If a new Selldone API behavior or project convention is discovered and applied, update this file in the same change.

## Reusable Fashioni V2 Starter

- `starter.manifest.json` is the machine-readable design contract. Keep its required and forbidden markers aligned with the tracked storefront.
- The reusable setup skill lives in `skills/setup-selldone-fashion-store/`; its bootstrap helper exports only Git-tracked files and records `.starter-provenance.json` in a new project.
- `npm run setup` is the mandatory repoint step after cloning. For a different shop it rewrites the visible title-case identity and clears the previous domain, OAuth client, and audience mappings.
- Do not reintroduce the fixed rail, tick ruler, progress ruler, or any page gutter reserved for them. The v2 starter intentionally has none of those artifacts in source or generated HTML.
