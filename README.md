# Omnio

Omnio is a static-first, API-backed Selldone marketplace built from the Fashioni v2 storefront. Its interface uses an original blue, search-first retail system inspired by the information density and marketplace patterns of large general retailers, without copying Walmart code, branding, copy, or media.

Production: https://omnio.selldone.shop

## Live commerce model

| Area | Live source |
| --- | --- |
| Shop | Selldone shop `15596`, handle `marko-5vMFPy7t` |
| Catalogue | 322 physical products |
| Fashion seller | Alio (`6178`): 195 products, 1,603 variant offers |
| Electronics seller | Merino (`6179`): 127 products, 397 variant offers |
| Inventory | 2,000 vendor offers with exact canonical variant quantities |
| Checkout | Browser-direct Selldone XAPI |
| Hosting | [Cloudflare Workers Static Assets](https://omnio.selldone.shop) |

The homepage, product cards, product pages, seller directory, and dedicated seller pages are data-driven. `storefront/marketplace-config.js` contains only public fallback presentation metadata and the restored audience shortcut mirror; live prices, stock, product data, and public vendor records remain in Selldone.

## Marketplace routes

- `/` — marketplace homepage with mixed Alio/Merino merchandising
- `/shop.html` — all products and live filters
- `/vendors.html` — seller directory
- `/vendor.html?vendor=alio` — Alio fashion storefront
- `/vendor.html?vendor=merino` — Merino electronics storefront
- `/brands.html` — live brand discovery
- `/product.html?id=<id>` — product detail with seller attribution

## Data and security boundaries

- Do not place API tokens, client secrets, private keys, or MCP credentials in browser code or `shop.config.json`.
- Product, variant, price, stock, basket, authentication, and checkout data are loaded from Selldone.
- `All Products`, `Departments`, `Sellers`, and audience links are presentation routes, not synthetic catalogue wrappers.
- Audience shortcuts are restored from the validated migration snapshot because Selldone's public product list omits shortcut relationships.
- Alio and Merino seller attribution is derived from the product's real category/vendor allocation, not from a cosmetic label.
- `dist/`, local backups, and the supplied Walmart reference screenshots are build inputs neither to Git nor to deployment.

## Provenance

This project was bootstrapped from `alireza-selldone/selldone-fashioni` at commit `53286ca3b8f6ce805ec42509c61fe045c03cc036`. The reusable Fashioni starter and its acceptance contract remain under `skills/setup-selldone-fashion-store/`.
